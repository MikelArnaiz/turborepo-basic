## Must
- [ ] document all steps to create the monorepo

## Should
- [ ] try again with yarn, perhaps yarn 2 or yarn 3
- [ ] try what happens with the PR bot and GH action if 
    - [ ] instead of a changeset file, commit the changes from `changeset version`, the `package.json`'s updated
- [ ] deploy top vercel and document learnings

## Have to
- [ ] add the missing files described in the impact analisys, e.g 
    - [ ] Prettier
    - [ ] editorconfig

## Nice to have
- [ ] import or create this repo in Catawiki org
    - [ ] need npm token
- [ ] create meaningful examples
- [ ] Understand how does "[Linked Packages](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/fixed-packages.md#fixed-packages)" and "[Fixed Packages](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/fixed-packages.md#fixed-packages)" work.
- [ ] [Remote caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching)
